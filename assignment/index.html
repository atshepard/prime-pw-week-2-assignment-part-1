    <h1>Week 2 Assignment - Part 1</h1>
    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p> I would be very interested to know about general best practices to start building habits from the beginning:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> How often should I leave comments? After every line, every code block, etc. Is there an accepted standard?</li>
      <li> During this assignment, I commented out some code so I could re-write it in a new way. How often is old code left behind?</li>
      <li> Is there general rules about when to use ternary operators and when to stick to regular if/else statements?</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Thanks for all you do!</p>
